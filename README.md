# Pentomino Puzzle Solver

Unlock the charm of the Pentomino Puzzle with this elegant C++ solution. The Pentomino puzzle, a classic in the world of logic puzzles, challenges you to fit 12 pentomino pieces into a 6x10 grid. This project is a C++ program that solves the 6x10 Pentomino puzzle using the Knuth Algorithm X with Doubly Linked Lists, called DLX. It prints out all solutions to the Pentomino puzzle for a NxM rectangular board.

## Project Overview

The Pentomino puzzle solver is a fascinating application that demonstrates the power of algorithms in solving complex logic puzzles. The solver is integrated into the `main.cpp` file and takes advantage of modern C++11 features to provide an efficient and elegant solution.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Pentomino Puzzle Solver, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command `git clone https://github.com/MR-ARMA/Pentomino.git`.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the project files.
3. Compile the C++ code using a C++11 compatible compiler. For example, if you're using g++, you can use the command `g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o main`.
4. Run the compiled program using the command `./main`.
